## Create your Parse application

Go to the Parse website and create your Parse application: [https://www.parse.com/apps](https://www.parse.com/apps). 
The site has plenty of documentation if you run into any issues.

You need to take note of your `APPLICATION ID` and your `CLIENT ID`. 
You can find these in your application 'Settings' under 'Keys'.
